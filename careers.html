                <h4><b>What you’ll do as a Peaches Healthcare Care assistant?</b>
  
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A job as a home care assistant with The Peaches Healthcare is a varied and rewarding role.
                  <br>You will be visiting clients in their own home, perhaps preparing food, giving medication, providing personal care or just companionship, taking people out and about, or running errands. At the same time, you’ll be getting to know each client as an individual, making a personal connection and building trust.
                  <br>Your visits may be the highlight of the day for the people you see - and for those who sit alone for long hours, the visits could even be life-changing.
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Delivering care packages</b>

                  <br>Every client has an agreed care package. A visit could include specific tasks such as helping with a shower, changing the bed or doing the shopping. Sometimes, you might just be checking in to make sure the person is OK. And sometimes, you might simply need to be there to give a family carer a break.
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Helping with the little things</b>

                  <br>Often, little things can make a big difference. When you write and post a birthday card for a client with arthritic hands who can’t hold a pen firmly, or phone to make a bill payment for someone who can’t hear well, you’re taking away worry and making normal life possible.
                  <br>
                  <br><b> Being part of a professional team</b>

                  <br>For each client, you’ll be part of a small Peaches Healthcare team. You may also be liaising with other social and health care professionals. So good record-keeping and communication are vital, to make information is passed on and every client gets the care they need.

                  <br>

                  <br><b> Supporting families</b>

                  <br>As you develop in the role, you’ll also find yourself providing both information and emotional support and comfort to families. This support can be critical where families are seeing their loved one struggle with the symptoms of progressive conditions such as dementia.
                  <br>  <br><b>Helping develop our business</b>

                  <br> On top of your work with clients, you will also have the chance to be involved in developing our business. We recognise that our front-line carers know best what clients want and need, so you’ll have plenty of opportunity to contribute ideas and suggestions.
                  <br>  <br> <b>Feeling motivated and valued</b>

                  <br>Every day and every care visit will be different. Some will be tough, others joyous. But you will always be able to get out of bed knowing you’ll be helping people in need – and go home happy you’ve put a smile on someone’s face

                                               At Peaches, we know that team members can only give the best care if we provide the right training. This starts with a 12-week programme, at the end of which we decide whether to make a permanent job offer. The initial programme is then followed by ongoing training plus support to achieve NVQs.
                                            
                                            <br><br>  <b> Initial training</b>
                                            <br>  Your starting point will be our carefully designed 12-week initial training, induction and assessment programme. The programme leads to the nationally recognised Care Certificate. (If you currently have a valid certificate, you do not need to do the modules again, but can choose to as a refresher if you wish).
                                            <br>  At the same time, you’ll be shadowing other team members, getting to know the job and the clients first-hand. By the time you go on your first solo visit, you’ll be confident you can handle what’s expected of you.

                                             <br><br><b>  Initial shadowing and team support</b>
                                             <br>   Through the course of the 12 weeks, you will shadow team members on client visits. You’ll see a wide variety of clients, learning about their different needs and how to provide appropriate care. You will also take part in a question-and-answer session with other team members.


                                             <br><br> <b>Regular training sessions</b>
                                             <br> Our regular training sessions allow you to learn new knowledge and skills and refresh existing expertise. We cover a wide variety of health and care issues, from an introduction to specific conditions through to specialist techniques and updates on new approaches.


                                             <br><br><b> Ongoing training</b>
                                             <br>We run regular training sessions on health and care topics, share knowledge at team meetings, and give one-to-one support via managers. We will also require you to achieve at least NVQ level 2. On top of this, before taking on any new client, you will normally shadow existing carers. This means that by the time you start visiting the person alone, they will already know and trust you and you will know how to work with them.

                                             <br><br><b> NVQ Diplomas</b>
                                             <br>You’ll need to achieve a level 2 NVQ Diploma in Health and Social Care, with a level 3 Diploma for more senior care work. The Diplomas are national qualifications showing you have the essential skills and knowledge to provide care. We will support you fully as you work towards the qualifications.

                                             <br><br><b> Manager and team support</b>
                                             <br>Your manager will work closely with you to help you learn and develop. They will discuss progress with you regularly, and encourage you to give your perspective about how things are working. In addition, you’ll take part in monthly team meetings, where everyone can raise issues and discuss ideas.
