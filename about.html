                      <h4>Meet the Founders of Magical Hands Physiotherapy Clinic</h4>
                      <p>
                          Magical Hands Physiotherapy Clinic was founded by two dedicated professionals, Mr. Kowcigan Jambulingam (KJ) and Mr. Pugalendran Rajendran. Both share a deep passion for providing high-quality rehabilitative care that is affordable and accessible to everyone. Their vision has shaped the clinic into a place where expert care meets holistic healing.
                      </p>
  
                      <h4>The Beginning and Growth of Magical Hands</h4>
                      <p>
                          When Magical Hands was first established, it focused exclusively on physiotherapy services. However, as the demand for comprehensive care grew, the clinic expanded its offerings to include a variety of holistic treatments such as yoga therapy, pilates, Reiki healing, sports and remedial massage therapy, and meditation. This evolution allows Magical Hands to provide a well-rounded approach to healing, ensuring clients receive the most effective and tailored care.
                      </p>
  
                      <h4>Mr. Kowcigan Jambulingam (KJ)</h4>
                      <p>
                          KJ graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Physiotherapy from Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. University in India in 2009. He specializes in manual therapy, with a focus on treating musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. His dedication to manual therapy has led him to study advanced techniques like Mulligan's mobilization, myofascial release, and taping, which he incorporates into his treatments. KJ stays at the forefront of the physiotherapy field, continuously updating his skills with the latest advancements.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          KJ’s clinical experience is vast, having worked alongside esteemed sports physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, and orthopedic surgeons in India. In addition to his private practice, KJ also worked as a senior community physiotherapist with the NHS and local authorities, gaining invaluable experience in diverse healthcare settings. He holds an MBA in Healthcare Management, which enhances the operational efficiency of his private practice.
                      </p>
  
                      <h4>Mr. Pugalendran Rajendran (Pugal)</h4>
                      <p>
                          Pugal is a highly skilled physiotherapist who earned his Bachelor’s degree in Physiotherapy in India in 2009, where he graduated with distinction and was awarded the prestigious title of PHYSIO TOPPER. His expertise lies in neuro-vestibular physiotherapy, having worked in the neurological department under the guidance of the renowned Dr. Radha Krishnan, MD., DM (Neurologist). Together, they conducted research on vertigo and neuro-vestibular disorders, which led Pugal to master specialized rehabilitation techniques for these conditions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          With extensive experience working in both private and NHS settings in the UK, Pugal has successfully treated a wide range of patients, building a strong reputation for achieving positive outcomes in nearly every case. Like KJ, Pugal has completed an MBA in Healthcare Management, supporting the efficient management of the clinic.
                      </p>
  
                      <h4>Shared Expertise and Advancements</h4>
                      <p>
                          Both KJ and Pugal have completed diplomas in Musculoskeletal Medicine and Injection Therapy with Queen Margaret University (QMU) and the Society of Musculoskeletal Medicine (SOMM). They are currently working towards obtaining their MSc in Musculoskeletal Medicine, continually striving to enhance their expertise and offer the best possible care to their patients.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Together, KJ and Pugal form a dynamic team, combining their knowledge, experience, and commitment to patient care. At Magical Hands Physiotherapy Clinic, their vision is simple: to provide expert, compassionate care that helps individuals achieve optimal health and well-being.
