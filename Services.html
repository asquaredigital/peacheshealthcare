                  Peaches Health care live-in care arrangement is the ideal alternative to a care home. With our one-to-one support, you can stay safely in the comfort of your own home, enjoying familiar surroundings and routines.<br>
                  With live-in care, we provide a small team of carers who you get to know and trust. This means you can benefit from 24-hour support without the upheaval of moving to a care home or having to rely on friends and family. Holidays, sickness and emergencies are covered. Daily life can stay the same – or even get better!

                  <p>
                    <b>Help to keep living the life you love</b><br>
                    By continuing to live in your own home rather than moving into residential care, you can carry on seeing family and neighbours as you always have done, keep your pets, and stay involved in the community. And if you like to get out and about, we’ll help with that too.
                    <br><br> <img src="img/peaches/img (4).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">

                  <p>
                    <b>All-round support</b><br>
                    Your carers will help in whatever way you need them. From household tasks through to personal care and specialist support for specific medical conditions, we will agree a care plan that is right for you. We give staff extra training in specific requirements where needed.

                   <p>
                    <b>Short term or permanent live in care arrangements</b><br>
                    You can book live-in care to cover both short- and long-term needs. Shorter term arrangements can cover respite care while a family member takes a break, post-hospital care, and end-of-life support.

                    <p>
                    <b>An affordable alternative</b><br>
                    The cost of live-in care is often comparable to the cost of care home fees. For a couple who both need support, live-in care can even be cheaper than residential care. It’s also well worth considering if the costs of multiple daily care visits are starting to add up.

                    <p>
                      <b>Letting families become families again</b><br>
                      Arranging Peaches Healthcare live-in care can bring huge relief to families. Not only are family members freed from the daily strain of caring, they no longer need to fill the role of carer. This allows them to become husband, wife, son or daughter again, confident that caring responsibilities are in the hands of a professional.
                              </p>

                                <b>What live-in care costs</b><br>
                                The cost of live-in care depends on the level of service we provide. We will provide expert advice and clear pricing, so you can decide what will work best for you. We can also advise on social care funding.

                        <b>Care on your terms</b><br>
                        When you have a Peaches live in carer or companion, you’re in control. You decide what you want to do, and when. You’re not waiting for carers to visit at set times, and you can plan each day according to how you feel. Stick to a routine or ring the changes – it’s up to you!

                        <b>Valued companionship</b><br>
                        Our live-in care means there’s always a friend to chat to. Share meals, memories, and hobbies, enjoy TV shows together, potter in the garden. Trips become much easier too, with someone to take you out and about – or even on holiday.                                              </p>
  
                        <p>
                          <b>Arrange a care consultation</b><br>
                          The best way to see how our live-in care could work for you is to arrange for a free no-obligation care consultation. One of our senior staff members will visit you at a time that is convenient to you and discuss your care and wellbeing needs and advise on the most suitable options and costs                          </p>

                            <b>Live-in care for people living with dementia</b><br>
                            For people living with dementia, residential care is often seen as the only option once living alone is no longer possible. In fact, live-in care can often be a better alternative. Our specialist dementia carers give one-to-one attention in familiar surroundings, avoiding the disruption and stress of a move to a new and unfamiliar care home environment.<br>

                 <p> As a specialist provider of complex care services, we understand that living with a long-term condition and suffering from a lack of independence can be extremely challenging. You may fear that as your condition progresses, your only option would be to move into a nursing or residential home.
<br>Peaches Healthcare is able to supply a wide range of Care Assistants and Support Workers with specific skills, tailored to your complex care requirements, to support you to remain living in your own home.
<br><br><img src="img/peaches/img (15).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">


<br>We have a sustained record of success in providing high-quality bespoke care in almost all clinical and social settings, providing care for individuals with a range of needs including:
<br>• Palliative care
<br>• Head and Spinal Injury Rehabilitation
<br>• Home Ventilation and Respiratory Support
<br>• Renal care
<br>• Learning Disabilities Support
<br>We will develop a detailed person-centred care plan for you which will identify all of your requirements, enabling us to implement a highly effective care service. We regularly review this document with you to ensure that we continuously adapt our care service to meet your changing needs and preferences.
<br>Our service is outcome based, supporting you to live as independently as possible and empowering you to have choice and control over your care. We adopt a partnership approach, working closely with you and your family and other healthcare professionals involved in your care to ensure that a consistent approach is employed.
<br>Our high-quality care service can be a cost-effective alternative to nursing or residential home admission. Once we have carried out an assessment of your care requirements, we will provide you with a no obligation estimated cost for your proposed care package.

  <h4><b><br>Companionship</b>
    
  </h4>
 <p> 
 
  Everybody needs somebody, especially as we get older and struggle with being alone or keeping on top of daily errands and tasks. Loneliness can be caused by so many things and is an increasing challenge within our elderly communities. Whether it be not being able to see loved ones as often as we’d like or finding it harder to adjust to life after the sudden loss of a spouse.
  <br>With our standard companionship and support, you can be assured that our carers will provide you with the companionship you need. Having someone to talk to, listen to music with, help with shopping or making appointments on time.
  <br>Companionship focuses on the social aspect of care rather than assisting with personal or medical needs. The carer will soon become a trusted and friendly part of your day.
  <br><br><img src="img/peaches/img (18).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
 <br>If you live further afield from friends and family, companionship care is a great service to improve and sustain good mental wellbeing. At Peaches Healthcare, we have been matching clients and carers with similar interests and personalities, so we can promise to find someone who your loved one can develop a strong relationship with.
  <br>We understand that those who need a Companionship need more than a friend. Our carers are happy to help with a number of domestic tasks. Let us know which areas you’ll need help with and we’ll match the best carer for your needs.
  <br>• Meal preparation, light housework
  <br>• Domestic administration
  <br>• Cooking
  <br>• Light cleaning
  <br>• Laundry and ironing
  <br>• Pet care
  <br>• Shopping
  <br>• Collecting prescriptions and arranging appointments

    <h4><b><br>End of life care / Palliative care</b>
      
    </h4>
   <p> 
    <b>We understand how distressing it can be to see how a terminal illness is affecting a loved one. That’s where we can help; by providing specialist palliative care support so your family can make the most of your time together.
    </b>
    <br><br><img src="img/peaches/img (1).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">

      <br>Palliative care at home allows you to stay in the place you feel most comfortable, surrounded by memories and the people you love. With one-to-one support from a compassionate carer who is experienced in palliative care, you can have specialist support and symptom relief from serious illness, whenever it is needed.
    <br>Whether you are looking for a full-time live-in carer or intermittent visits from a local care team, we provide a full range of services for people living with illnesses, such as coping with cancer or nausea and vomiting. Our palliative care assistants follow the national palliative care guidelines. Our palliative carers cover all aspects of care including personal care, pain management for neurological and physical symptoms, administering medication, cooking meals, and companionship care.
    <br> We frequently work alongside a number of organisations including hospices, support groups, NHS continuing health care teams, and district nurses. This enables us to offer the right level of home care for both patients and family alongside other elements of your care plan.
    <br><br>The options for palliative care at home
    <br>There are many options for palliative care in the home. Here at Peaches Healthcare, our full range of home care services are regulated by the Care Quality Commission.
    <br>Unlike introductory agencies that offer palliative care, you will have a local care manager on-hand for if your symptoms change or if you need a response from your medical team. This fully-managed service offers you the extra reassurance that if your care requirements change, we can easily change the support to suit you.
    <br><br><b>The options for palliative care include:</b>
    <br><b>Live-in care</b>
    <br>Live-in care, places a specially trained live-in carer to provide support each day according to your requirements. Carefully chosen based on your personality and care needs, this carer will live with you at home supporting you with your day-to-day needs. Your carer will likely become a great friend or companion, helping to promote your independence and help you to get the most out of life with palliative care.
    <br><br><b>Regular home visits</b>
    <br><br><img src="img/peaches/img (13).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">

    <br>If you’d prefer support visits at specific times of the day – or overnight – your local Peaches Healthcare branch will provide the right level of care for you. Our support service ranges from a half-an-hour visit each week all the way through to several visits a day or nightly support. One of our expertly trained carers can support you to stay independent at home, so that you and your loved ones have complete reassurance that you’re being supported with care that’s adapted to you.
    <br><br><b>Respite care</b>
    <br>If your usual caregiver needs to take a break, we offer respite live-in care from as little as three days. We can step in quickly to support you with emergency care – whether you’ve been let down by your usual carer or they are taken ill – we’re here to help.
    <br><br><b>Benefits of palliative care at home</b>
    <br>One of the main benefits of receiving palliative care at home is that it allows somebody to spend their last months, weeks, and days in the place where they feel most at ease and safe: their home. This places them in the company of someone they know and trust whilst receiving palliative care. As well as being reassuring for the person receiving care, knowing this can give peace of mind to families and close friends too. Because of this, palliative care and hospice care are often synonymous with each other.
    <br>Having care at home instead of a hospital or hospice means less disruption for everybody. Round-the-clock care means that any changes in condition will be noticed and responded to quickly.
    <br>You can also be reassured that the person providing care is assessed to high standards and given specific palliative care training, enabling them to provide practical and emotional support to you all.
    <br><br><b>How quickly can palliative carers be arranged?</b>
    <br>With long-term illnesses, symptoms can change very quickly. The need to arrange palliative care can be very urgent, especially if someone’s in pain or distress.
    <br>We offer emergency home care and in many cases, we can begin arranging care within 24 hours of you getting in touch with us. This is especially useful if your situation doesn’t allow you to plan ahead. If you are currently in hospital or a residential setting, your local dedicated care manager can arrange support that will aid your move back home.
    <br>Please call us if you’d like to discuss the options. Our team is available seven days a week. In many instances, we can arrange for support to start within as little as 24 hours.
    <br><br><b>Who provides palliative care at home?</b>
    <br>Our carers are expertly trained to have an understanding and working knowledge of palliative care.
    <br>We also place some of our carers under a training programme specially built around administering palliative and end-of-life practices. The carers that are put through this additional programme have had previous experience in working to deliver high-quality palliative care.
    <br>This additional training enhances their previous knowledge and experiences of palliative care, to put you at peace of mind that you are receiving a quality and reliable person-centred practice in line with current NHS, NICE and CQC guidelines.
    <br>To find out more about our palliative care service or how we can support you, please contact a member of our care specialist team. We’re here seven days a week to talk through your options and can arrange a meeting with a local care manager when you’re ready to begin your health and social care.

      Life is short, and time spent with your loved ones should be quality time. You don’t have to shoulder all the care responsibilities alone. With high-quality, bespoke at home respite care, Peaches Healthcare is here to help and support you every step of the way.
    <br>  <br><b>At home respite care for family carers</b>
    <br>  If you care for a loved one, it is important to look after your own wellbeing too. Our Care Professionals can come to your home to give you a break from day-to-day caring of your loved one and offer you much-needed support.
    <br><br>  <b>Care and respite support services</b>
    <br>  Sometimes a little relief is needed to help a person to get back on their feet – for example, after a hospital stay, we can assist your loved ones with anything from an hour a day to live-in-care for a temporary amount of time.
    <br> <br><b>Let us help you</b>
    <br> By choosing our tailored respite services, you will have peace of mind and regain your own independence knowing that essential things are being taken care of.

<br><b>What is Domestic Support?</b>
<br>Domestic care is a range of services that help adults with day to day home tasks. Usually, this is when they are unable to do so or require assistance due to a disability or elderliness. Domestic care services form part of an overall domiciliary care package. This is where a team of care assistants offer home care and personal care.
<br><br><b>An alternative to residential care</b>
<br>Moving to a residential care service can be stressful and sometimes unnecessary. In many cases, elderly people will need some level of domestic care and support that doesn’t require relocating. When it’s safe to do so, we would recommend domestic support services at home over residential care.
<br>Our Clients’ homes are cherished and a place where memories have been made and families raised. It’s our aim and responsibility to allow our Clients to continue living in their homes. By offering domestic support, we promote independence and enable our Clients to remain in their own home. Domestic care support also goes hand-in-hand with our Companionship Care Service.
<br>In order to provide optimum care, our caring team will provide a full assessment and bespoke care plan. This is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure high standards of care are met consistently. Domestic support is available for different levels of care. Whether that’s part of a dementia care package, care for learning disabilities or a more complex care solution.
<br><br><b>Domestic Care for Older People</b>
<br><img src="img/peaches/img (3).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">

<br>Typically, as we grow older tasks around the house become trickier and more stressful. While moving into a care home may be right for some people, staying at home and getting support where it’s needed can be much more beneficial both for mental and physical health. Domestic care for older adults can be a lifeline and help retain their independence.
<br>Domestic support is usually part of a wider home care services package. Combining personal care, companionship and even skill enhancement support.
<br><br><b>Local Domestic Care and Support</b>
<br>It’s important that domestic care and any live-in care is provided by a local service by local carers. This ensures continuity of care and helps make the overall experience a much more enjoyable one

          <h4><b><br>Our Night-time Care</b>
            
          </h4>
         <p> 
          Overnight care for elderly people is a common request for us at Peaches Health Care. Indeed, we understand that care is not only needed during the day. As such, our comprehensive range of services include overnight elderly in-home care too: a Peaches Health Carer will stay in the house through the night to provide assistance and support as required.
         <br> The benefits of having an overnight care service in place include peace of mind and reassurance that your loved one will be cared for whatever happens through the night. Our Carers are carefully matched to your needs and will go the extra mile. We are confident that this ethos will shine through the service we provide.
          <br>Our care during night is delivered as two options, either a sleepover service or a waking night service.

          <br><br><img src="img/peaches/img (16).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
          <br><b>Sleepover Care</b> 
<br><b>What is sleepover care?</b>
<br>In a sleepover service, our Carer will require a bed and a quiet place to sleep. They are on duty throughout the night and will wake up to provide assistance, if needed, up to three times. They can be woken up with a bell or called for assistance. Typically, the Carer will wake up immediately if they hear any stirring in the house.
<br>
<br><b>Waking Nights</b> 
<br><b>What is waking night care?</b>
<br>
A waking night service is required when a person does not sleep through the night, needs continual attention, and cannot be left alone. In this case a Carer will stay awake all night to watch and assist and be there for your loved one. A waking nights service is generally slightly expensive than a sleepover service. 
<br>

              <b>"SHORT-TERM CARE AT HOME, TO AID RECOVERY AFTER DISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL"</b>
<br>Let The Peaches Healthcare staff support your needs to relearn the skills required to keep your loved ones safe and independent at home.
<br><img src="img/peaches/img (7).jpg" width="400px" height="300px">

<br>Reablement care is a short and intensive service, usually delivered in your home. This service is offered to allow people to return home after a stay in hospital or to prevent the need to go to hospital. The purpose of reablement care is to support people who have experienced deterioration in their health and/or have increased support needs to relearn the skills required to keep them safe and independent at home. People using reablement care experience greater improvements in physical functioning and improved quality of life. The focus of reablement is on restoring independent functioning rather than resolving health care issues.
<br>The objective is to help you relearn how to do things for yourself. Reablement appears to be welcomed by people receiving the service and represents an investment that may produce savings. Here at Peaches Healthcare, we always encourage independence and love to empower people to do things themselves as this results in positive outcomes.
<br>Speak to one of our excellent advisors about your reablement care requirements on 0207 998 7950, we’d be delighted to help you.
